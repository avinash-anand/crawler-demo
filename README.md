#Web-crawler-demo

To Run, Just execute <b>"mvn clean compile exec:java"</b>
If you want to change domain url, go to demo.crawler.Main and change there in the constant.

Points to improve:-
1. This is a single threaded web crawler. Multi-threaded would give better performance. For bigger sites, this may run for many minutes.
2. it assumes https is different from http. this could be fixed
